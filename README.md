# 📝 TinyMCE with Local Storage Integration  

A **TinyMCE**-based rich text editor that saves your work automatically to **localStorage**. This ensures that your text remains safe, even if you accidentally close the browser or refresh the page. A perfect project for learning how to integrate TinyMCE with client-side storage solutions.

## ✨ Features  

- 🖋️ **Rich Text Editing**: Use TinyMCE to create and format text with a modern editor.  
- 💾 **Auto-Save to LocalStorage**: Automatically saves content in the browser’s localStorage every few seconds.  
- 🔄 **Content Restoration**: Retrieve saved content when you reopen or refresh the page.  
- 🌐 **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across different devices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- **TinyMCE**: Rich text editor for modern web apps.  
- **HTML5**: Structuring the application.  
- **CSS3**: Styling the editor and layout.  
- **JavaScript**: Handling localStorage operations and editor interactions.  

---

## 🌟 How It Works  

1. **Initialize Editor**: The TinyMCE editor is loaded into the page.  
2. **Auto-Save Content**: Content is saved to localStorage every 5 seconds or on keypress.  
3. **Restore Content**: If localStorage contains previously saved content, it is loaded into the editor when the page is reopened.  
4. **Clear Content**: Users can reset the editor and clear localStorage data if needed.

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Customize Auto-Save**:  
  Modify the auto-save interval in `script.js` (default: 5 seconds):  
  ```javascript  
  const autoSaveInterval = 5000; // 5000 ms = 5 seconds  
  ```
